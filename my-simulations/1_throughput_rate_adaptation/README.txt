400 clients randomly distributed in an area
varying number of aps partial-randomly placed/grid structure
throughput aggregated over each ap, which is proportional to number of covered clients
each client consumes 250Kbps
aodv/olsr + udp/tcp
realtime throughput + overall throughput/delay
rate adaptation
