Mesh Simulator (forked from ns3-3.29)

1. Modifications from ns3-3.29
1) 802.11s support 802.11ac/n
    - mesh-wifi-interface-mac.cc
    - wifi-remote-station-manager.cc
        -- GetDataTxVector () will use data txvector for MESH and BLOCK_ACK management frames.
        -- This makes 802.11s HWMP able to find correct MAC layer routing.
2) legacy rate adaptation with 802.11ac/n
    - arf-ht-wifi-manager.h
    - arf-ht-wifi-manager.cc
    - aarf-ht-wifi-manager.h
    - aarf-ht-wifi-manager.cc
        -- Add 802.11ac/n MCS rate to legacy codes
        -- Like minstrel-wifi-manager and minstrel-ht-wifi-manager
3) link failure support
    - period-propagation-loss-model.h
    - period-propagation-loss-model.cc
        -- Three different models discribe link failure, node failure and channel quality variation.
        -- Link failure increases propagation loss between two nodes to infinity
        -- Node failure increases propagation loss between one node and the other nodes to infinity
        -- Channel quality variation adds a random number to propagation loss
        -- Not based on each packet, but on each period (constant or a random length)

2. Scratch code
1) mesh-loc-0.cc
    - Grid structure simulation
2) mesh-loc-1.cc
    - Takes location of APs from practical data as input
    - Throughput decided by simulation
3) mesh-loc-2.cc
    - Takes location of APs and corresponding thoughput from practical data as input
4) mesh-loc-0-1.cc, mesh-loc-1-1.cc, mesh-loc-2-1.cc
    - Same function of each code mention above, but include link failure model
